# Historical Analysis and Future Predictions of Gold Prices
Understanding Trends, Volatility, and Influencing Factors

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
The base data for this dataset was retrieved from https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart.

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:
* Year: The specific year for the data.
* Average Closing Price: The average closing price of the stock for the year.
* Year Open: The opening price of the stock at the beginning of the year.
* Year High: The highest price of the stock during the year.
* Year Low: The lowest price of the stock during the year.
* Year Range Price: The range of stock prices for the year (difference between high and low).
* Year Close: The closing price of the stock at the end of the year.
* Annual % Change: The percentage change in the closing price from the previous year to the current year.

## Problem Definition
Gold has historically been a valuable asset and commodity, serving as a hedge against inflation, a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty, and a component in diverse investment portfolios. Understanding the historical trends in gold prices can provide critical insights for investors, policymakers, and economists. This analysis leverages a dataset of historical gold prices to explore patterns, identify significant changes, and forecast potential future trends.

## Hypothesis
Significant economic events (e.g., recessions, financial crises) lead to substantial changes in gold prices.

## Vision
To leverage historical gold price data to provide a clear understanding of the factors influencing gold price movements and to create a robust framework for predicting future trends, aiding investors, policymakers, and economists in making informed decisions.

## Objective
* Identify and analyze the long-term trends in gold prices based on average closing prices over consecutive years.
* Determine which years experienced significant increases or decreases and investigate potential reasons for these fluctuations.
* Analyze the difference between the highest and lowest prices each year to assess how volatile the market has been and what implications this volatility may have for investors.
* Explore the relationship between the opening prices and average closing prices of gold for each year. Determine if there is a consistent pattern or correlation between these two variables.
* Utilize historical data to forecast potential trends in gold prices. 

## Key Insights
* **Year Range Price:**
   * **Highest Years:** 1980, 2011, and 2020
   * **Lowest Years:** 1985 to 2005

* **'Highest % Change' (1979):**
   * Triggered by the Iranian Revolution and ensuing Middle East tensions, which caused a surge in oil prices.

* **'Lowest % Change' (1981):**
   * Occurred during a period of economic stability, marked by tight monetary policy measures aimed at combating high inflation rates.

* **'Highest Closing Price' (1980, 2012, 2020):**
   * 1980: Influenced by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and sustained geopolitical tensions.
   * 2012: Amid the Eurozone debt crisis, concerns about economic stability drove gold prices to peak levels.
   * 2020: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered global economic uncertainty, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold, pushing prices to record highs.

* **'Low Closing Prices' (1987 to 2005):**
   * Characterized by several economic downturns:
     * 1987: The Black Monday stock market crash.
     * 2000-2001: The dot-com bubble burst.
     * 2005: Despite economic growth and low inflation, gold prices remained subdued due to reduced demand for safe-haven assets.

## Next Steps
* Utilize insights from recent trends and volatility analysis to optimize investment portfolios. By understanding periods of high volatility and significant price changes, investors can make more informed decisions on buying, holding, or selling gold.
* Closely monitor key economic indicators that have been shown to influence gold prices. This includes tracking inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Implement responsive policies to mitigate adverse effects on the gold market.
* Conduct detailed studies on the significant price changes identified in this analysis. Investigate the underlying economic events and policy changes during those periods to better understand their impact on gold prices. This research can contribute to more robust economic models and predictions.
